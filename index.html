                <h4>Pulp Fiction</h4>
                <p>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who conceived it with Roger Avary.[4] Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of crime in Los Angeles, California. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.
                    Pulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's masterpiece, with particular praise for its screenwriting.[5] The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style.

                <h4>Sin city</h4>
                <p>As far as comic book movies go, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's adaptation of the latter's graphic novel Sin City ranks among the very best, and though the film is ensemble-driven in nature, Willis is clearly positioned as the star. His John Hartigan is positioned as a hero early on, when he tries to stop a child murderer (Nick Stahl) from raping and killing young Nancy Callahan. This may be a heightened world, but Willis is still the good guy, the one who not only wants to protect Nancy, but is willing to lay his life --and his freedom -- on the line to ensure her safety.

                    Years later, after being framed into silence, Hartigan is fresh out of prison and eager to reconnect with Nancy (Jessica Alba), who has grown up to be an exotic dancer. The child killer he stopped earlier is back and hungry for revenge, and as long as Hartigan is alive, she'll always be in danger. He's forced to make an impossible choice, one that Willis sells quite well for an actor who doesn't have a whole lot of death scenes.</p>
